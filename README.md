# project4-scheduling-owen
Comparing FIFO and SJF average turnaround times.

Instructions:

1. User will be prompted to enter a multiple. This multiple will be used to help generate the random jobs. Since the arrival time and run time are a random number from 1 to 9, the multiple is then used to multiply these numbers to make them larger, although it is not neccesary (e.g. entering 1 is ok, anything less then that will crash)

2. After the user enters his multiple, the user will then be prompted to enter the amount of jobs he wants to run. (e.g. If the user enters 5, then 5 jobs with random run and arrival times will be created).

3. The average turn around time for each scheduler will then be printed to the screen.
